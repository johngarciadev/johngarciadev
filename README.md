I started to work as a Technical Support Engineer just after my graduation in 2009. After working for 10 years in the same position in different companies, I decided to change my focusing and joined to a bootcamp to learn about programming languages and new technologies.

There I met again with C. I had an interesting experience learning more details about this language, even more than when I learn about it for the first time in the school. Also I started to fall in love with the Linux Command Line and the CLI. My world has changed since then.

The bootcamp was only the beginning. There I had the chance to know Python, I participated in team projects such developing a Shell, to recreate the Printf command, to create an AirBnB clone and finally, the final project, a fundrising website. My knowledge of tools had expanded and I keep training myself to gain more technical skills.

This portfolio represents my growing as a developer, my commitment to my new life style and an opportunity to reach better job opportunities.
